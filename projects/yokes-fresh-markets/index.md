> <strong>Fresh products. And fresh thinking.</strong><br/> At Yoke's, being your neighborhood grocer is about more than stocking nature’s best products at a fair price - it's a promise to create a better experience, in and beyond the store. It's rounding up the freshest local products from area farms. It’s remaining locally owned, employee owned, and active in our communities. It’s a focus on environment, finding innovative ways to offer a greener shopping experience. But above all, it’s a commitment to help you live the fresh life.
