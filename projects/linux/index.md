While working with the [Linux Foundation](http://wwws.linuxfoundation.org) we redesigned and rebuilt the [Linux.com](http://wwws.linux.com) site. I was the lead front-end developer on this project and was responsible for taking an existing site with all of the data and content and panels layouts and creating a custom fully responsive theme within the Drupal framework. I worked closely with the lead designer as we designed and worked through the theme development process in only a month.
