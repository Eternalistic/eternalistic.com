# {{ page.title }}

I contracted with the [Linux Foundation](http://wwws.linuxfoundation.org) for two years and was responsible for all of their front-end development and theming. I primarily worked with the Drupal framework and was responsible for 100+ [Collaborative Project sites](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects) in which I either built the theme for or supported by making custom changes.

I worked on [Linux Foundation](http://wwws.linuxfoundation.org) and all of their sub-sites ([Training](https://training.linuxfoundation.org), [Identity](https://identity.linuxfoundation.org), [Events](https://events.linuxfoundation.org)) and even [Linux.com](https://www.linux.com).
